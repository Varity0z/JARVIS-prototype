This is a prototype it has 2 commands listed

youtube video: Jarvis search up <query for youtube video>  (only opens up the first result)

recording: Jarvis Clip (only records for 20 seconds/editable soon ?)

how to use, first put the VAI.py in your documents.

run this command:

cd C:\Users\<your user, for me its user>\documents

then run this command

python VAI.py

It should start up with "Hello sir, start with Jarvis to begin"

use any two of the commands, you can test them by playing a game windowed or fullscreen

 i need results!!!

Ps: you will need python 3.11.9
